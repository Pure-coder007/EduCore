# 🎓 EduCore API

## 🧭 Overview

**EduCore** is a robust, scalable **School Management System API** built with **Django REST Framework**, **Celery**, and **Redis**.  
It manages students, lecturers, courses, results, and payments — with real-time notifications, wallet transactions, and background email tasks.  

> Built to test and showcase full-stack backend engineering skills, from authentication to async tasks, caching, and Docker orchestration.

## 💡 Developer Notes

- Students get ₦50000 demo credit on registration (via signal).  
- Emails are sent via Celery workers (non-blocking).  
- Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data (departments, leaderboard).  
- All sensitive operations (results, payments) require admin approval.
